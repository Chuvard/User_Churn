# User_Churn
SQL queries to calculate a User Churn

### Purpose: During this project we will analyze Codeflix database in order to calculate subscription churn rates between two segments of users.

### Given: The dataset provided to us is containing subscription data for users who were acquired through two distinct channels, and it grouped into one SQL table named "subscriptions".

The given SQL table includes the following columns:

	1. 'id’ 				- the subscription id
	2. 'subscription_start’ 	- the start date of the subscription
	3. 'subscription_end' 	- the end date of the subscription
	4. 'segment’ 			- this identifies which segment the subscription owner belongs to
